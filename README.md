# Computer-Vision-Projects
Computer vision deals with how computers extract meaningful information from images or videos. It has a wide range of applications, including reverse engineering, security inspections, image editing and processing, computer animation, autonomous navigation, and robotics. 

In this repository, we’re going to explore 50 great OpenCV projects, from beginner-level to expert-level. For each project, you’ll see the essential guides, source codes, and datasets, so you can get straight to work on them if you want.

Thanks and regards,
